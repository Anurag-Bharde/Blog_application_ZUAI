- **User Dashboard**: Once logged in, users are directed to a dashboard where they can view, create, and manage their blog posts.

#### 2. Feedback and Interactivity
- **Loading Indicators**: The application provides clear feedback during loading states, such as when fetching data, submitting forms, or navigating between pages. This ensures users are aware of ongoing processes.
- **Confirmation Modals**: Before performing critical actions like editing or deleting posts, users are prompted with confirmation modals. This helps prevent accidental changes and gives users control over their actions.

#### 3. Error Management
- **User-Friendly Error Messages**: If an error occurs, the application displays user-friendly messages explaining the issue and suggesting possible actions the user can take.
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: In case of unexpected failures, fallback mechanisms are in place to guide users back to a stable state, minimizing disruption and enhancing reliability.

### Application Flow Overview

1. **Sign-In Process**
   - **Sign-In Page**: The application begins with the Sign-In page, where users are prompted to enter their **username** and **password**.
   - **Authentication**: After entering the credentials, the application verifies them against the stored user data. If the credentials are correct, the user is granted access to the dashboard. If incorrect, an error message is displayed, prompting the user to try again.
   - **Redirect**: Authenticated users are redirected to the main dashboard, where they can view and manage their blog posts.

2. **Sign-Up Process**
   - **Sign-Up Page**: If a user does not have an account, they can navigate to the Sign-Up page via a link on the Sign-In page.
   - **Sign-Up Form**: The Sign-Up form requires the user to provide the following information:
     - **Username**: A unique identifier for the user.
     - **Email**: The user’s email address for communication and account recovery.
     - **Password**: A secure password that the user will use to log in.
     - **Confirm Password**: A field to re-enter the password, ensuring the user’s input is accurate.
   - **Account Creation**: Upon submitting the form, the application checks for any validation errors (e.g., password mismatch, existing username). If all inputs are valid, the user’s data is stored in the database, and the account is created.
